Since :ref:`version-0.06`, We use srain.im as domain name of this project, 5 years have passed, I decided to stop renewing for srain.im

As you see, the domain name is now migrated to **srain.silverrainz.me**.

Meanwhile, our homepage/blog (:del:`srain.im`) and documentation (:del:`doc.srain.im`) are merged. We now only have a single site (it is srain.silverrainz.me) powered by Sphinx. And we use ABlog__ extension to provide blog function. The :ghrepo:`SrainApp/srain.im` repository will be archived.

The srain.im TLD expires after **19th June 2022**, please update your bookmarks as soon as possible, thank you.
