.. _commands-playground:

Playground
==========

User can run commands in two ways, the one way is typing them into the input
entry of chat buffer.

The another way is writing the commands to the ``server.auto-run`` and
``chat.auto-run`` configuration items. For more details, please refer to
:doc:`config`.

.. _commands-syntax:

Syntax
======

A command is a line of string that has the following format, different elements
are separated by whitespace::

    /<name|alias> [subcommand] [<option> [value]]... [argument]...

User should use ``name`` to invoke a command.
The command's ``name`` starts with a slash ``/`` and doesn't contain any
whitespace, such as: ``/join``.
Some commands have ``alias`` that can be used instead of ``name``,
for example, user can use ``/j`` instead of ``/join``.

.. note::

   When you want to send a message starts with a slash, please prepend
   another slash to the message.
   For example, you want to send "/this is a slash prefixed message", you need
   to type "//this is a slash prefixed message".

A ``subcommand`` is a instruction behind the command name, it is optional.

An ``option``, as its name, is optional too, starts with a hyphen ``-`` and may
has a ``value``.

``option`` is often used as the switch of a flag or a way to change some
default values. For example, The command ``/connect -tls -port 6697``,
option ``-tls`` is just a flag that tells srain use secure connections with TLS.
And ``-port`` requires a ``value``, if ``-port`` is not specified, program will
use the default value ``6667``. Check :ref:`commands-connect` for more details.

If a ``value`` starts with a hyphen ``-`` or contains whitespaces, it should be
enclosed by single quotation mark ``'``.

.. note::

    All ``option`` should appear behind ``subcommand`` (If any), and before
    ``argument``.

An ``argument`` is similar to ``value``, but commonly it doesn't have a default
value so it can not be omitted (actually it depends on the implement of the
command). If the first ``argument`` starts with a hyphen ``-``, it should be
enclosed by single quotation mark ``'``. If an ``argument`` contains whitespaces,
it should be quoted too. Specially, the last argument can contain whitespace
without quoted.

If you want to use a single quotation mark in a quoted text, use backslash ``\``
to escape it. For backslash itself, use double backslash ``\\``.

you can render it to a more easy-to-read format via the following commands::

   /pattern add xmpp \[(?<sender>[^:]+?)\] (?<content>.*)

The forwarded meessage will look like "<xmpp_user> xmpp_message", and the
original message sender "xmppbot" will be displayed as message remark.
